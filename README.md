## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use [this link](https://github.com/AndualemSebsbe/Complete-Javascript-Course/archive/master.zip) instead.

### Q2: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure! Here you go:
